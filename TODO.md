# QuantaDB TODO List

## Summary
**Total Items**: 5
**Completed**: 4 âœ…
**Pending**: 1 (0 High ðŸ”´, 1 Medium ðŸŸ¡)
**Last Updated**: June 18, 2025

## Completed Items âœ…

### 1. Apply Write Timeouts in Connection Handler âœ…
**Location**: `internal/network/connection.go`
**Issue**: SetWriteTimeout method exists but is never called
**Impact**: Connections can hang indefinitely on write operations, causing resource exhaustion
**Solution**: Apply write deadlines alongside read deadlines in the main message loop
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Completed**: June 18, 2025 - Added write deadline calls before all write operations in connection handler

### 2. Implement UPDATE and DELETE Operations âœ…
**Status**: SQL parser ready, needs storage integration
**Components implemented**:
- UpdateOperator with storage backend
- DeleteOperator with storage backend
- MVCC versioning for updates (simplified)
- Tombstone marking for deletes
**Impact**: Core SQL functionality incomplete without these operations
**Estimated Time**: 8-12 hours
**Completed**: June 18, 2025 - Implemented UPDATE and DELETE operators with MVCC support

### 3. Add Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) âœ…
**Purpose**: Essential for durability and crash recovery
**Components implemented**:
- Log record format with CRC32 checksums
- In-memory WAL buffer with configurable size
- Segment-based log files with automatic rotation
- Recovery manager with three-phase recovery (analysis, redo, undo)
- Checkpoint mechanism for limiting recovery time
- Integration with storage operations (InsertRow, DeleteRow)
- Page LSN tracking for recovery
- Transaction record chaining
**Impact**: Database now has durability and crash recovery capabilities
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Completed**: June 18, 2025 - Implemented complete WAL system with recovery and checkpoints

## Pending High Priority Items ðŸ”´

None currently!

## Pending Medium Priority Items ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Integrate B+Tree Indexes with Query Planner
**Status**: B+Tree implementation exists but unused
**Tasks**:
- Update query planner to consider indexes
- Implement index-backed scan operators
- Add cost estimation for index vs sequential scan
- Update statistics based on actual data
**Impact**: Poor query performance without index usage
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days

## Next Steps

**Recommended Order**:
1. âœ… **Apply Write Timeouts** (Quick security fix, 1-2 hours) - COMPLETED
2. âœ… **UPDATE/DELETE Operations** (Core functionality, 8-12 hours) - COMPLETED
3. âœ… **WAL Implementation** (Critical for production, 2-3 days) - COMPLETED
4. **Index Integration** (Performance optimization, 1-2 days) - Next priority

## Additional Items for Future Consideration

From `docs/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md`:
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: Generic error codes, missing extended query protocol
- **Transaction State**: Timing issues with transaction cleanup
- **Code Quality**: Redundant flush calls, hardcoded version strings

From `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`:
- **Authentication System**: No user authentication implemented
- **Distributed Features**: Single-node only currently
- **Advanced SQL**: CTEs, Window Functions not supported
- **Monitoring**: No metrics or health endpoints
