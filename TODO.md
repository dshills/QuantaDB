## Technical Debt & Architecture Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Replace string-based error matching in connection.go with proper error types

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **CLI Tools**: Implement functionality for `cmd/quantactl` and `cmd/test-client` (see TODO.md files in those directories)
