## Current Sprint (Q1 2025 - Phase 1: Performance Optimization)

### Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡

#### 1. Transaction-Storage Full Integration
**Status**: Phase 1 complete - MVCC row format implemented
**Location**: `internal/txn/`, `internal/storage/`, `internal/sql/executor/`
**Completed** (Phase 1):
- [x] Enhanced row format with MVCC metadata
- [x] MVCCStorageBackend with atomic transaction ID handling
- [x] Timestamp-based visibility checks
- [x] Raw iterator for MVCC-aware scans
**Completed** (Phase 2):
- [x] Phase 2: Thread transaction context through operations
  - Updated ExecContext to use only MVCC transactions
  - Added SnapshotTS and IsolationLevel fields
  - Updated network handler to pass transaction context
  - Modified all DML operators to set transaction ID on storage
  - Removed legacy transaction usage
  - Updated server initialization to use MVCCStorageBackend
**Completed** (Phase 3):
- [x] Phase 3: Add visibility filtering to all scan operators
  - Updated StorageBackend interface to accept snapshot timestamps
  - Modified MVCCStorageBackend to use snapshot timestamps for visibility
  - Updated all scan operators to pass snapshot timestamp from context
  - Fixed timestamp generation to use logical timestamps consistently
  - Fixed isolation level handling for Read Committed vs Repeatable Read
  - All MVCC isolation tests now pass
**Completed** (Phase 4):
- [x] Phase 4: Implement version chain management
  - Refactored UpdateRow to use in-place updates with version backup
  - Created VersionChainIterator for traversing version chains
  - Updated GetRow to use version chain traversal
  - Added validation and statistics utilities
  - All version chain tests passing
**Completed** (Phase 5):
- [x] Phase 5: Create vacuum process for old versions
  - Created HorizonTracker for safe vacuum threshold management
  - Integrated horizon tracking with transaction manager
  - Implemented VacuumScanner for dead version detection
  - Built VacuumExecutor with batch processing and relinking
  - Added VACUUM SQL command with parser and operator support
  - Fixed vacuum to handle standalone dead versions
  - All vacuum tests passing successfully
**Remaining Tasks** (Phase 6):
- [ ] Phase 6: Comprehensive testing and validation
**New Issues Found**:
- [x] Fix transaction test API mismatches - BeginTransaction signature changed (DONE)
- [x] Fix TestVacuumWithConcurrentReads timeout issue (DONE)
- [x] Fix concurrent insert performance test - slice bounds error in raw iterator
- [x] Remove or deprecate non-MVCC ScanOperator that bypasses visibility checks
- [x] Extract timestamp helpers to shared utility package (low priority)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days remaining (Phase 6)
**Impact**: True ACID compliance with proper isolation

#### 2. Query Optimization Improvements
**Status**: Statistics collection complete, advanced optimizations pending
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement join reordering based on cost
- [ ] Enhance predicate pushdown for more cases
- [ ] Add histogram-based selectivity for range queries
**Estimated Time**: 5 days
**Impact**: Advanced query optimizations using real statistics

## Future Roadmap (from ROADMAP.md)

### Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Q2 2025)
- Authentication & user management
- Role-based access control
- Backup & recovery tools
- Monitoring & metrics
- Admin dashboard

### Phase 3: Advanced SQL (Q3 2025)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Stored procedures & triggers
- JSON/JSONB support
- Array types

### Phase 4: Distributed Features (Q4 2025)
- Streaming replication
- Horizontal sharding
- Raft consensus
- Distributed transactions

## Quick Reference

### Build & Test
```bash
make build          # Build server and CLI
make test          # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Generate coverage report
golangci-lint run  # Run linter
```

### Test Storage Features
```sql
-- All these operations now work with persistence!
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM users;
```
