**Next Step**: Test with real PostgreSQL drivers (JDBC, pq, psycopg2)
**Impact**: Prepared statements now work - all PostgreSQL drivers can connect!

### Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡

#### 3. PostgreSQL Error Code Mapping
**Status**: Generic errors, need SQLSTATE codes
**Location**: Throughout codebase, centralize in `internal/errors/`
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create error code mapping system
- [ ] Map all errors to PostgreSQL SQLSTATE codes
- [ ] Update network layer to send proper error responses
- [ ] Document error codes
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: Better client compatibility and debugging

#### 4. Transaction-Storage Full Integration
**Status**: MVCC exists but not fully integrated with storage
**Location**: `internal/txn/` and `internal/storage/`
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Connect transaction manager with storage operations
- [ ] Implement visibility checks in scan operators
- [ ] Add transaction ID to all row operations
- [ ] Implement vacuum process for old versions
**Estimated Time**: 1 week
**Impact**: True ACID compliance with proper isolation

#### 5. Query Optimization Improvements
**Status**: Statistics collection complete, advanced optimizations pending
**Completed**:
- [x] Cost-based optimization framework (`internal/sql/planner/cost.go`)
- [x] Statistics structures with histogram support (`internal/catalog/stats.go`)
- [x] Selectivity estimation functions
- [x] Basic predicate pushdown optimization
- [x] ANALYZE command for statistics collection
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement join reordering based on cost
- [ ] Enhance predicate pushdown for more cases
- [ ] Add histogram-based selectivity for range queries
**Estimated Time**: 5 days
**Impact**: Advanced query optimizations using real statistics
