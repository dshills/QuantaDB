# QuantaDB TODO List

## Summary
**Last Updated**: December 20, 2024
**Project Status**: MVCC transaction-storage integration in progress
**Recent Updates**: 
- Implemented MVCC row format with transaction metadata (Phase 1 complete)
- Added MVCCStorageBackend with visibility checks
- Fixed all critical concurrency and safety issues from code review
- See `docs/transaction-storage-integration-plan.md` for full integration plan

## Current Sprint (Q1 2025 - Phase 1: Performance Optimization)

### Medium Priority 🟡

#### 1. Transaction-Storage Full Integration
**Status**: Phase 1 complete - MVCC row format implemented
**Location**: `internal/txn/`, `internal/storage/`, `internal/sql/executor/`
**Completed** (Phase 1):
- [x] Enhanced row format with MVCC metadata
- [x] MVCCStorageBackend with atomic transaction ID handling
- [x] Timestamp-based visibility checks
- [x] Raw iterator for MVCC-aware scans
**Remaining Tasks** (Phases 2-6):
- [ ] Phase 2: Thread transaction context through operations
- [ ] Phase 3: Add visibility filtering to all scan operators
- [ ] Phase 4: Implement version chain management
- [ ] Phase 5: Create vacuum process for old versions
- [ ] Phase 6: Comprehensive testing and validation
**Estimated Time**: 10 days remaining
**Impact**: True ACID compliance with proper isolation

#### 2. Query Optimization Improvements
**Status**: Statistics collection complete, advanced optimizations pending
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement join reordering based on cost
- [ ] Enhance predicate pushdown for more cases
- [ ] Add histogram-based selectivity for range queries
**Estimated Time**: 5 days
**Impact**: Advanced query optimizations using real statistics

## Future Roadmap (from ROADMAP.md)

### Phase 2: Enterprise Features (Q2 2025)
- Authentication & user management
- Role-based access control
- Backup & recovery tools
- Monitoring & metrics
- Admin dashboard

### Phase 3: Advanced SQL (Q3 2025)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Stored procedures & triggers
- JSON/JSONB support
- Array types

### Phase 4: Distributed Features (Q4 2025)
- Streaming replication
- Horizontal sharding
- Raft consensus
- Distributed transactions

## Quick Reference

### Build & Test
```bash
make build          # Build server and CLI
make test          # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Generate coverage report
golangci-lint run  # Run linter
```

### Test Storage Features
```sql
-- All these operations now work with persistence!
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM users;
```
