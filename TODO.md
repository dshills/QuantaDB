## Current Sprint (Q1 2025 - Phase 1: Performance Optimization)

### High Priority ðŸ”´

#### Test PostgreSQL Drivers
**Status**: Extended Query Protocol complete, ready for driver testing
**Location**: Create `test/drivers/` directory
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Test Go pq driver with prepared statements
- [ ] Test Go pgx driver with batch operations  
- [ ] Test JDBC driver (PreparedStatement)
- [ ] Test Python psycopg2 with server-side cursors
- [ ] Test Node.js pg driver
- [ ] Document any compatibility issues
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Impact**: Verify real-world driver compatibility

#### 1. ~~Index-Query Planner Integration~~ âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: Fully implemented with cost-based optimization!
**Location**: `internal/sql/planner/` and `internal/index/`
**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Query planner considers indexes in plan generation
- [x] Index-backed scan operators (IndexScan)
- [x] Cost estimation for index vs sequential scan
- [x] Cost-based index selection with selectivity estimation
- [x] Integration tests for index usage
**Completion Date**: December 2024
**Impact**: Queries now use indexes when beneficial based on cost analysis

#### 2. ~~Extended Query Protocol~~ âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: Fully implemented with parameter support!
**Location**: `internal/network/` and `internal/sql/`
**Completed Tasks**:
- [x] Parse/Bind/Execute message handling
- [x] Prepared statement and portal management
- [x] Parameter storage in portals
- [x] ParameterRef handling in query planner
- [x] Parameter substitution integrated in execution path
- [x] Unit tests for parameter substitution
**Completion Date**: December 2024
**Next Step**: Test with real PostgreSQL drivers (JDBC, pq, psycopg2)
**Impact**: Prepared statements now work - all PostgreSQL drivers can connect!

### Medium Priority ðŸŸ¡

#### 3. PostgreSQL Error Code Mapping
**Status**: Generic errors, need SQLSTATE codes
**Location**: Throughout codebase, centralize in `internal/errors/`
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create error code mapping system
- [ ] Map all errors to PostgreSQL SQLSTATE codes
- [ ] Update network layer to send proper error responses
- [ ] Document error codes
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days
**Impact**: Better client compatibility and debugging

#### 4. Transaction-Storage Full Integration
**Status**: MVCC exists but not fully integrated with storage
**Location**: `internal/txn/` and `internal/storage/`
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Connect transaction manager with storage operations
- [ ] Implement visibility checks in scan operators
- [ ] Add transaction ID to all row operations
- [ ] Implement vacuum process for old versions
**Estimated Time**: 1 week
**Impact**: True ACID compliance with proper isolation

#### 5. Query Optimization Improvements
**Status**: Cost-based optimizer framework complete, needs statistics collection
**Completed**:
- [x] Cost-based optimization framework (`internal/sql/planner/cost.go`)
- [x] Statistics structures with histogram support (`internal/catalog/stats.go`)
- [x] Selectivity estimation functions
- [x] Basic predicate pushdown optimization
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement ANALYZE command for statistics collection
- [ ] Implement join reordering based on cost
- [ ] Enhance predicate pushdown for more cases
**Estimated Time**: 1 week
**Impact**: Better query plans with actual table statistics

CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT, email TEXT);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');
UPDATE users SET email = 'newemail@example.com' WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM users;
```
