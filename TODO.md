  - Basic aliases work ‚úÖ, but not multiple aliases for same table
- [ ] **Correlated Subqueries in SELECT**: Critical for 5 queries
  - Required for Q2, Q17, Q20, Q21, Q22
  - Example: `SELECT (SELECT AVG(x) FROM t2 WHERE t2.id = t1.id) FROM t1`

## Technical Debt & Architecture Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Replace string-based error matching in connection.go with proper error types

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **CLI Tools**: Implement functionality for `cmd/quantactl` and `cmd/test-client` (see TODO.md files in those directories)
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Add comprehensive integration tests for disk-backed storage
- [ ] **Extended Query Protocol Tests**: Add tests for timeout, SSL, and protocol error scenarios
- [ ] **Module Decoupling**: Reduce tight coupling between network, parser, planner, executor, and storage modules

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Buffer Pool Eviction Policy**: Add configurable eviction policy to handle memory pressure
- [ ] **Connection Backpressure**: Add queuing mechanism for connection handling beyond MaxConnections
