## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage > 80% for new code
- Integration tests for all SQL features
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Test with real PostgreSQL clients

### Code Standards
- Follow Go best practices
- Use interfaces for extensibility
- Document all public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Review Checklist
