# DISTINCT Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented DISTINCT support in QuantaDB, enabling duplicate row elimination in query results.

## Changes Made

### 1. Parser (internal/sql/parser/)
- Added `Distinct bool` field to `SelectStmt` AST node
- Updated parser to recognize DISTINCT after SELECT keyword
- Modified String() method to include DISTINCT in output

### 2. Planner (internal/sql/planner/)
- Created `LogicalDistinct` plan node
- Integrated DISTINCT into query planning after projection
- Placed before ORDER BY to ensure correct semantics

### 3. Executor (internal/sql/executor/)
- Implemented `DistinctOperator` with hash-based deduplication
- Fixed hash function to handle int32 values correctly
- Added separators between values to prevent hash collisions
- Buffers all unique rows during Open() for iteration

## Test Results

All DISTINCT queries work correctly:
- ✅ DISTINCT single column
- ✅ DISTINCT multiple columns  
- ✅ DISTINCT * (all columns)
- ✅ DISTINCT with ORDER BY
- ✅ Proper duplicate detection

## Implementation Details

### Hash-Based Approach
- Uses FNV-64 hash for row comparison
- Stores seen hashes in a map for O(1) lookup
- Copies rows to avoid data corruption

### Performance Considerations
- Memory usage: O(n) where n is number of unique rows
- Time complexity: O(n) for processing input
- Future optimization: Sort-based DISTINCT for large datasets

## Known Limitations

1. **Memory Usage**: Current implementation loads all unique rows into memory
2. **Column Resolution**: WHERE clause with DISTINCT has column resolution issues (separate bug)
3. **COUNT(DISTINCT)**: Not implemented yet (requires aggregate function changes)

## Next Steps

1. Implement spill-to-disk for large DISTINCT operations
2. Add COUNT(DISTINCT) support
3. Optimize for sorted input
4. Add DISTINCT ON (PostgreSQL extension) support
