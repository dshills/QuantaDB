# GROUP BY Crash Already Fixed

## Summary

The GROUP BY server crash mentioned in TODO.md has already been fixed in commit da291e9 (December 23, 2024).

## Previous Fix Details

The fix addressed:
1. **Nil pointer issues** causing SIGSEGV in AggregateOperator
2. **Initialization problems** with groupIter being nil
3. **State management** to ensure valid state even on errors

### Key Changes Made:
- Always initialize `groupIter` to empty slice instead of nil
- Added `initialized` flag for proper state tracking
- Enhanced error handling to maintain valid state
- Proper initialization in both constructor and Open() method

## Testing Results

Comprehensive testing confirms GROUP BY is working correctly:
- ✅ Simple GROUP BY with COUNT
- ✅ GROUP BY with SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- ✅ GROUP BY with multiple aggregates
- ✅ GROUP BY multiple columns
- ✅ GROUP BY with aggregate expressions (SUM(a)/SUM(b))
- ✅ Empty GROUP BY results

## MVCC Considerations

When testing GROUP BY queries, ensure proper MVCC setup:
1. Set transaction ID when inserting: `storageBackend.SetTransactionID(txn.ID())`
2. Set snapshot timestamp in context: `ctx.SnapshotTS = txn.ReadTimestamp()`

Without these, queries may return 0 rows due to MVCC visibility checks.

## Action Required

TODO.md should be updated to remove the GROUP BY crash from the critical issues list, as it has been resolved.
