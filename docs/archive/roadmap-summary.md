# QuantaDB Implementation Roadmap Summary

## Current State (December 22, 2024)

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- PostgreSQL wire protocol compatibility
- Basic SQL parsing and planning
- Simple table scans and COUNT(*) queries
- Data loading (all TPC-H tables loaded with 86,803 rows)
- MVCC transactions and WAL
- B+Tree indexes (created but not used)

### üö® Critical Blockers
- **GROUP BY queries crash server** (SIGSEGV)
- **JOIN column resolution fails** ("column not resolved" errors)
- **Aggregate expressions unsupported** in projections
- **Missing DISTINCT and LIMIT** support

### üéØ Goal
Complete TPC-H benchmark suite (22 queries) with competitive performance

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Week 1-2) üö®
**Goal**: Stop server crashes, enable basic queries

| Priority | Task | Status | Blocker Level |
|----------|------|--------|---------------|
| P0 | Fix GROUP BY server crash | ‚ùå | Critical |
| P0 | Fix JOIN column resolution | ‚ùå | Critical |
| P1 | Support aggregate expressions | ‚ùå | High |

**Success Criteria**:
- All 4 TPC-H queries run without crashing
- Basic GROUP BY and JOIN queries work
- No server instability

### Phase 2: Core SQL Features (Week 3-4) üìù
**Goal**: Complete essential SQL feature set

| Task | Complexity | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| DISTINCT support | Medium | High |
| LIMIT/OFFSET | Low | Medium |
| BYTEA data type | Low | Low |

**Success Criteria**:
- DISTINCT queries execute correctly
- LIMIT works with ORDER BY
- All PostgreSQL core types supported

### Phase 3: Performance Infrastructure (Week 5-7) ‚ö°
**Goal**: Enable performance optimization

| Task | Complexity | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| Index scan operator | High | Very High |
| Query planner integration | High | Very High |
| Cost model calibration | Medium | High |

**Success Criteria**:
- Indexes used when beneficial
- Query performance significantly improved
- Cost estimates accurate

### Phase 4: TPC-H Completion (Week 8-12) üèÅ
**Goal**: Implement remaining TPC-H queries

| Query Type | Queries | Features Needed |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Simple aggregation | Q1, Q6 | Working GROUP BY |
| Subquery patterns | Q4, Q11 | EXISTS optimization |
| Multi-way JOINs | Q2, Q7, Q9 | Join ordering |
| Window functions | Q17, Q18, Q20 | New operator |

**Success Criteria**:
- 18+ TPC-H queries working
- Performance baseline established
- No correctness issues

### Phase 5: Advanced SQL (Week 13-16) üöÄ
**Goal**: Support complex query patterns

| Feature | Effort | TPC-H Queries Unlocked |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Window functions | High | Q2, Q17, Q18, Q20 |
| Correlated subqueries | Medium | Q21, Q22 |
| Additional aggregates | Low | Q17 (STDDEV) |

**Success Criteria**:
- All 22 TPC-H queries working
- Complex patterns optimize well
- Performance competitive

## Risk Analysis

### High Risk üî¥
- **GROUP BY fix complexity**: May require significant executor refactoring
- **Index integration scope**: Touches query planner, optimizer, executor
- **Window functions**: New paradigm, complex implementation

### Medium Risk üü°
- **Join ordering optimization**: Algorithm complexity
- **Performance tuning**: Many variables to optimize
- **Timeline pressure**: Ambitious schedule

### Low Risk üü¢
- **DISTINCT/LIMIT**: Well-understood features
- **BYTEA**: Straightforward type addition
- **Simple TPC-H queries**: Existing features should handle

## Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Mitigations
1. **Incremental implementation**: Feature flags, gradual rollout
2. **Extensive testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, regression tests
3. **Performance monitoring**: Benchmark every change
4. **Code review**: All changes reviewed for quality

### Schedule Mitigations
1. **Weekly checkpoints**: Adjust scope based on progress
2. **Buffer time**: 20% buffer in each phase
3. **Parallel work**: Where possible, work on multiple features
4. **Scope flexibility**: Can defer advanced features if needed

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Critical)
- ‚úÖ No server crashes during benchmark
- ‚úÖ All 4 existing TPC-H queries complete
- ‚úÖ Memory usage stable

### Phase 3 (Performance)
- ‚úÖ Queries 10x faster with indexes
- ‚úÖ Index usage in query plans
- ‚úÖ Cost estimates within 2x of actual

### Phase 4 (Feature Complete)
- ‚úÖ 18+ TPC-H queries working
- ‚úÖ Query times under 10 seconds (scale factor 0.01)
- ‚úÖ Results match reference implementation

### Phase 5 (Advanced)
- ‚úÖ All 22 TPC-H queries working
- ‚úÖ Performance within 5x of PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ No correctness issues

## Resource Requirements

### Development Focus
- **Week 1-4**: Full focus on critical fixes
- **Week 5-8**: Performance and index work
- **Week 9-16**: TPC-H query implementation

### Testing Infrastructure
- Automated regression testing
- Performance benchmark automation
- Memory leak detection
- Correctness validation

### Documentation
- Implementation guides for each phase
- Performance optimization notes
- Query optimization best practices

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Set up debugging environment for GROUP BY crash
2. Create minimal test case for column resolution
3. Review existing GROUP BY implementation

### This Week
1. Fix GROUP BY crash (top priority)
2. Fix JOIN column resolution
3. Add comprehensive test coverage

### Next Week
1. Implement DISTINCT support
2. Add LIMIT/OFFSET
3. Begin index integration planning

## Long-term Vision
