# TPC-H Implementation Progress Summary

## Date: December 2024

### Completed Tasks

1. **Fixed Date Indexing**
   - Added time.Time support to B+Tree index encoding
   - Enables indexing on DATE and TIMESTAMP columns
   - Fixed "unsupported type for indexing: time.Time" error

2. **Fixed Float32 Support**
   - Added float32 cases to SUM and AVG aggregate functions
   - Added comprehensive float32 comparison support in expressions
   - Enhanced type system to handle float32 with all numeric types
   - Fixed "unsupported type for comparison: float32" errors

3. **Fixed Data Generation**
   - Updated TPC-H data generator to use DATE literals
   - Changed from '1993-04-09' to DATE '1993-04-09' format
   - Enables proper loading of TPC-H data

4. **Loaded TPC-H Dataset**
   - Successfully loaded all 8 TPC-H tables at scale factor 0.01
   - Region: 5 rows
   - Nation: 25 rows  
   - Supplier: 10 rows
   - Customer: 150 rows
   - Part: 200 rows
   - Partsupp: 800 rows
   - Orders: 15,000 rows
   - Lineitem: 60,003 rows

5. **Verified SQL Features**
   - Table aliases work (e.g., customer c)
   - 2-way and 3-way joins work (but slow on large datasets)
   - GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT work
   - Date arithmetic with INTERVAL works
   - BETWEEN operator works
   - Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) work

### TPC-H Query Status

#### Working Queries
- **Q6** ✅ - Forecasting Revenue Change (simple aggregation with filters)
- **Q1** ⚠️ - Pricing Summary Report (simplified version works, full version has type issues)

#### Partially Working (need testing/fixes)
- **Q3** ⏳ - Shipping Priority Query (times out on full dataset, needs optimization)
- **Q5** ❓ - Local Supplier Volume (not tested yet)
- **Q8** ❓ - National Market Share (needs table alias support for same table multiple times)
- **Q10** ❓ - Returned Item Reporting (not tested yet)

#### Not Implemented (missing SQL features)
- **Q2, Q17, Q18, Q20** - Require window functions
- **Q2, Q17, Q20, Q21, Q22** - Require correlated subqueries in SELECT
- **Q4, Q7, Q9, Q11-Q16, Q19, Q21-Q22** - Various other queries

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Performance**
   - 3-way joins are very slow (Q3 times out)
   - Need query optimization improvements
   - Consider adding more indexes

2. **Type System**
   - Some type coercion issues remain (Q1 full version fails)
   - May need better type inference for complex expressions

3. **Missing SQL Features**
   - Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, etc.)
   - Correlated subqueries in SELECT clause
   - STDDEV aggregate function
   - Multiple table aliases for same table (nation n1, nation n2)

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Tables don't persist across server restarts
   - Need better benchmark infrastructure

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Debug and fix Q1 type issues
   - Optimize Q3 performance
   - Test Q5, Q8, Q10

2. **Feature Implementation**
   - Implement window functions for Q2, Q17, Q18, Q20
   - Implement correlated subqueries for advanced queries
   - Add STDDEV aggregate function

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add indexes on foreign key columns
   - Improve join algorithms
   - Consider hash joins for large datasets

### Summary

Good progress on TPC-H implementation! We've successfully:
- Fixed critical blockers (date indexing, float32 support)
- Loaded the complete TPC-H dataset
- Got 1-2 queries working (Q6 fully, Q1 partially)
- Identified specific features needed for remaining queries

The foundation is solid - QuantaDB can handle the TPC-H schema and basic queries. The main work remaining is implementing advanced SQL features and performance optimization.
