# Linter Configuration Analysis

## Summary

The current golangci-lint configuration is generally well-structured but has some rules that are overly aggressive for a database project. Database code has unique patterns that legitimate linters might flag incorrectly.

## Overly Aggressive Rules

### 1. **goconst** (Currently Too Strict)
- **Current**: Flags any 3-character string appearing 3+ times
- **Problem**: SQL keywords like "AND", "OR", "=", ">=", etc. are flagged
- **Recommendation**: Increase to min-len: 10, min-occurrences: 5

### 2. **dupl** (Threshold Too Low)
- **Current**: Threshold of 100 characters
- **Problem**: Database operators and test cases have legitimate similar patterns
- **Recommendation**: Increase threshold to 150, exclude operator files

### 3. **unparam** (Inappropriate for Interfaces)
- **Problem**: Database interfaces often need consistent signatures across implementations
- **Example**: Not all storage backends use all parameters
- **Recommendation**: Disable entirely

### 4. **prealloc** (Not Suitable for Dynamic Queries)
- **Problem**: Query processing often can't know result sizes in advance
- **Example**: JOIN results, filtered queries
- **Recommendation**: Disable entirely

### 5. **nilnil** (Common Iterator Pattern)
- **Problem**: Flags `return nil, nil` which is standard for EOF in iterators
- **Example**: `Next() (*Row, error)` returning `nil, nil` at end
- **Recommendation**: Disable or add exclusions for iterator patterns

### 6. **revive Rules**
- **package-comments**: Not all internal packages need detailed comments
- **exported**: Too strict about documenting every exported type
- **Recommendation**: Disable these specific rules

## Reasonable Rules to Keep

1. **Security** (gosec) - Important for database security
2. **Bug Detection** (staticcheck) - Catches real issues
3. **Style** (gofmt, goimports) - Maintains consistency
4. **Error Handling** - Though errcheck is already disabled
5. **Code Quality** (dogsled, nakedret, unconvert)

## Already Good Decisions

The configuration already makes some good choices:
- Excludes test files from dupl, goconst, gosec
- Disables errcheck (too noisy)
- Disables shadow and fieldalignment in govet
- Has reasonable timeout (5m) for large codebase

## Recommended Changes

1. **Adjust Thresholds**:
   ```yaml
   goconst:
     min-len: 10
     min-occurrences: 5
   
   dupl:
     threshold: 150
   ```

2. **Disable Overly Strict Linters**:
   ```yaml
   disable:
     - unparam
     - prealloc
     - nilnil
   ```

3. **Add Pattern-Specific Exclusions**:
   ```yaml
   rules:
     # Ignore dupl in operators
     - path: 'internal/sql/executor/.*operator.*\.go'
       linters:
         - dupl
     
     # Ignore nilnil in iterators
     - path: '.*\.go'
       text: 'return both the `nil` error and invalid value'
       source: 'return nil, nil.*// EOF'
   ```

## Database-Specific Considerations

Database projects have unique patterns that general-purpose linters may not handle well:

1. **Operator Similarity**: Many operators (Scan, Filter, Join) have similar structure
2. **Interface Compliance**: Consistent signatures even if not all params used
3. **Iterator Patterns**: `nil, nil` for EOF is standard
4. **SQL Keywords**: Short repeated strings are part of the domain
5. **Test Patterns**: Similar test cases for different data types

The recommended configuration in `.golangci-recommended.yml` addresses these concerns while maintaining code quality standards.
