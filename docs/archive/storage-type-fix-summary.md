# Storage Type Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed widespread "expected int32, got int64" serialization errors that were blocking INSERT operations, foreign keys, and transaction tests.

## Root Cause
The INSERT operator's `convertValueToColumnType` function was converting all INTEGER values to `int64`, but the storage layer and type system expect INTEGER to be `int32` (matching PostgreSQL's INTEGER type).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed INSERT Type Conversion
**File**: `internal/sql/executor/insert.go`
- Changed INTEGER case in `convertValueToColumnType` to convert values to `int32` instead of `int64`
- Added bounds checking for int64 to int32 conversion (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
- Added proper error messages for out-of-range values

### 2. Fixed Test Data
**File**: `internal/sql/date_arithmetic_integration_test.go`
- Changed from `types.NewBigIntValue(int64(id))` to `types.NewIntegerValue(int32(id))`
- Ensures test data matches the INTEGER column type

### 3. Fixed Test Expectations
**File**: `internal/sql/executor/insert_test.go`
- Updated test to expect `int32` instead of `int64` for INTEGER columns

## Results
✅ Fixed test: TestConcurrentTransactionIsolation
✅ Fixed test: TestForeignKeyConstraints  
✅ Fixed test: TestConcurrentInsertPerformance
✅ Fixed test: TestInsertOperatorWithParameters
✅ Unblocked further testing of SQL functionality

## Remaining Issues
- TestDateArithmeticIntegration now fails with column resolution errors (different issue)
- TestForeignKeyCascadeDelete fails with cascade behavior (unrelated)
- TestCheckConstraints fails with parser issue (unrelated)

## Lessons Learned
1. PostgreSQL type compatibility is critical - INTEGER must be int32, BIGINT must be int64
2. Test data creation must use the correct type helper functions
3. Direct row creation (bypassing INSERT) can mask type conversion issues

## Next Steps
With storage serialization fixed, we can now proceed to fix:
1. GROUP BY server crash
2. JOIN column resolution 
3. Other SQL functionality issues
