# CREATE INDEX Implementation Summary

## Task Completed: Run all tests and fix any errors ✅

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Fixed Planner Test Failures**
   - Updated `TestPlannerErrors` to `TestPlannerDDL` since CREATE TABLE/INSERT are now supported
   - Added catalog setup for INSERT test to provide the required table context
   - All planner tests now pass

2. **Verified All Tests Pass**
   - Parser tests: ✅ All passing (CREATE/DROP INDEX parsing works correctly)
   - Planner tests: ✅ All passing (DDL planning support verified)
   - Executor tests: ✅ All passing (CREATE/DROP INDEX integration tests pass)
   - Catalog tests: ✅ All passing (index metadata management works)
   - Index tests: ✅ All passing (B+Tree implementation verified)
   - Storage tests: ✅ All passing (disk persistence layer works)
   - WAL tests: ✅ All passing (durability and recovery work)

3. **Test Coverage Summary**
   - catalog: 78.3%
   - engine: 90.4%
   - index: 62.6%
   - executor: 53.9%
   - parser: 81.7%
   - planner: 45.6%
   - storage: 77.5%
   - txn: 77.1%
   - wal: 70.6%

### Code Quality

Ran `golangci-lint` and found 87 issues, mostly minor:
- Style issues (goconst, godot, gofmt)
- Security warnings (gosec - mostly about random number generation in tests)
- Unused functions in `index_scan.go` (expected - these are for Phase 2 implementation)
- Exhaustive switch warnings (can be addressed but not critical)

### Current CREATE INDEX Status

**Phase 1: COMPLETED ✅**
- SQL Parser support for CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX and DROP INDEX
- Query Planner integration with LogicalCreateIndex/LogicalDropIndex
- Query Executor operators for index operations
- Catalog integration for index metadata
- Index Manager integration for actual index creation
- Comprehensive tests covering all layers

**Next Steps (Phase 2-4)**
- Phase 2: Implement IndexSelection optimizer rule (functions already drafted in `index_scan.go`)
- Phase 3: Create PhysicalIndexScan operator
- Phase 4: Enhance cost model for index operations

### Key Files Modified/Created
- `internal/sql/parser/token.go` - Added index tokens
- `internal/sql/parser/parser.go` - Added index parsing
- `internal/sql/parser/ast.go` - Added index AST nodes
- `internal/sql/planner/planner.go` - Added index planning
- `internal/sql/planner/ddl_plans.go` - Added logical index plans
- `internal/sql/executor/create_index.go` - New file with operators
- `internal/sql/executor/executor.go` - Added operator builders
- `internal/sql/planner/index_scan.go` - Phase 2 prep (unused functions)

### Usage Examples

```sql
-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_username ON users (username);

-- Drop index
DROP INDEX idx_users_email;
```

All requested tasks have been completed successfully. The system now supports CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX operations from SQL parsing through execution.
