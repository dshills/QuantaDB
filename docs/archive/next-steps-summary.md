# Next Steps Summary - Phase 3: Advanced Index Optimization

**Date**: December 21, 2024  
**Current Status**: Phase 2 Query Optimization Complete âœ…  
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Advanced Index Optimization

## Executive Summary

With Phase 2 complete (sort-merge join, semi/anti joins, join reordering), we're ready to tackle Phase 3: Advanced Index Optimization. This phase will dramatically improve query performance through multi-column indexes, covering indexes, and index intersection capabilities.

## What We'll Build

### 1. Multi-Column Index Support (3 days)
- **Composite Keys**: Support indexes on multiple columns (e.g., `(customer_id, order_date, status)`)
- **Smart Matching**: Match predicates like `WHERE a = ? AND b = ? AND c > ?`
- **Expected Impact**: 50-80% query time reduction for multi-predicate queries

### 2. Index-Only Scans / Covering Indexes (2 days)
- **Direct Index Reads**: Avoid table access when all columns are in the index
- **Visibility Maps**: Track which pages have all-visible tuples for MVCC
- **Expected Impact**: 90% I/O reduction for projection queries

### 3. Index Intersection (1 day)
- **Bitmap Operations**: Combine multiple single-column indexes
- **Smart Selection**: Choose between single index vs intersection
- **Expected Impact**: Better performance for queries with multiple predicates

### 4. Additional Optimizations (1 day)
- **Index Condition Pushdown**: Filter during index scan
- **Partial Indexes**: Indexes with WHERE clauses
- **Expected Impact**: Further 10-20% improvements

## Why This Phase Next?

1. **High Impact**: Index optimizations provide the biggest performance gains
2. **Foundation Ready**: We have B+Tree indexes, just need integration
3. **User Visible**: Queries will run noticeably faster
4. **Enables Next Phases**: Better indexes enable advanced query transformations

## Implementation Approach

### Week Schedule
- **Monday**: Composite key implementation in B+Tree
- **Tuesday**: Index matching for composite predicates  
- **Wednesday**: Query planner integration, testing
- **Thursday**: Index-only scan implementation
- **Friday**: Index intersection, bitmap operations
- **Weekend**: Integration testing and benchmarking

### Key Technical Challenges
1. **Composite Key Ordering**: Proper lexicographic comparison
2. **NULL Handling**: Composite keys with NULL values
3. **MVCC Compatibility**: Index-only scans need visibility checks
4. **Memory Management**: Bitmap operations for large tables

## Success Metrics

### Performance Goals
- TPC-H Q6 (range query): 5x improvement with composite index
- Covering index queries: 90% I/O reduction
- Multi-predicate queries: 2-3x improvement with index intersection

### Quality Goals
- 100% backward compatibility
- No regression in existing queries
- Memory usage stays reasonable

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files
- `internal/index/composite_key.go` - Composite key implementation
- `internal/sql/planner/index_matcher.go` - Advanced index matching
- `internal/sql/executor/index_only_scan.go` - Index-only scan operator
- `internal/sql/executor/bitmap_scan.go` - Bitmap index operations
- `internal/storage/visibility_map.go` - MVCC visibility tracking

### Modified Files
- `internal/index/btree.go` - Support composite keys
- `internal/sql/planner/cost.go` - Cost estimation for new index types
- `internal/sql/planner/index_scan.go` - Multi-column index planning
- `internal/catalog/index.go` - Extended index metadata

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Composite key comparison and serialization
- Index matching algorithm correctness
- Bitmap operation correctness

### Integration Tests
```sql
-- Multi-column index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders ON orders(customer_id, order_date, status);
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100 AND order_date > '2024-01-01';

-- Covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON products(category_id) INCLUDE (name, price);
SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE category_id = 5;

-- Index intersection
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending' AND order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- Composite vs single-column indexes
- Index-only scan vs regular scan
- Index intersection vs single index

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Complex NULL handling in composite keys
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test cases, follow PostgreSQL semantics

2. **Risk**: Memory usage for bitmap operations
   - **Mitigation**: Implement size limits and disk spilling

3. **Risk**: MVCC visibility complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Start simple, optimize incrementally

## After Phase 3

With advanced indexes complete, Phase 4 (Query Transformations) becomes much more powerful:
- Projection pushdown can leverage covering indexes
- Subquery decorrelation benefits from better join performance
- CTE optimization can use index-backed operations

## Getting Started

1. Review the detailed plan: `docs/planning/phase3-index-optimization-plan.md`
2. Start with composite key implementation in B+Tree
3. Build incrementally with tests at each step
4. Benchmark frequently to validate improvements

## Summary

Phase 3 will deliver dramatic performance improvements that users will immediately notice. Multi-column indexes, covering indexes, and index intersection are foundational features that modern databases require. With our solid B+Tree implementation and query optimizer in place, we're perfectly positioned to implement these advanced index optimizations.
