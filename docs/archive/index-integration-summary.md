# Index-Query Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete index-query integration for QuantaDB, fixing critical bugs where indexes were not being maintained during DML operations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. INSERT Operator Enhancement
- Added `indexMgr` field to `InsertOperator` struct
- Created `SetIndexManager()` method for dependency injection
- Modified `Open()` method to update indexes after each row insertion
- Converts row data to map format required by index manager
- Properly encodes RowID to byte slice for index storage

### 2. UPDATE Operator Enhancement  
- Added `indexMgr` field to `UpdateOperator` struct
- Created `SetIndexManager()` method
- Modified update logic to:
  - Delete old index entries before updating row
  - Update the row in storage
  - Insert new index entries after update
- Ensures index consistency during updates

### 3. DELETE Operator Enhancement
- Added `indexMgr` field to `DeleteOperator` struct  
- Created `SetIndexManager()` method
- Modified delete logic to remove index entries before deleting row
- Maintains index consistency during cascading deletes

### 4. CREATE INDEX Population
- Implemented `populateIndex()` method in `CreateIndexOperator`
- Scans existing table data and inserts into new index
- Handles rollback on failure (drops index from both catalog and manager)
- Converts row data and RowID to proper formats for indexing

### 5. Executor Integration
- Modified `buildInsertOperator()` to pass index manager
- Modified `buildUpdateOperator()` to pass index manager  
- Modified `buildDeleteOperator()` to pass index manager
- Ensures all DML operators receive index manager reference

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Kept index updates at the executor level rather than pushing into storage backend, maintaining clean architecture

2. **Transaction Safety**: Index updates occur within same transaction context as data modifications

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with TODOs for future rollback improvements

4. **Performance**: Efficient RowID encoding using byte slices

## Testing
Created comprehensive integration test covering:
- Index creation on existing data
- INSERT operations updating indexes
- UPDATE operations maintaining index consistency
- DELETE operations removing index entries
- Composite index functionality
- Query plan verification for index usage

## Future Improvements

1. **Rollback Support**: Implement proper rollback of index operations on failure
2. **Statistics Collection**: Implement index statistics for better query planning
3. **Index Hints**: Add support for index hints in SQL parser
4. **Performance Optimization**: Consider batch index updates for bulk operations

## Impact
This implementation fixes critical bugs where:
- CREATE INDEX only worked for new data, not existing rows
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations did not maintain indexes
- Indexes became stale immediately after any data modification

Now indexes are properly maintained throughout the data lifecycle, enabling efficient query execution with accurate results.
