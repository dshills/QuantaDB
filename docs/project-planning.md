# QuantaDB Project Planning

## Project Status Summary
**Current Version**: v0.1.0-alpha  
**Development Stage**: Pre-production (Core functionality complete)  
**Key Achievement**: PostgreSQL-compatible SQL database with MVCC transactions

### What Works Today
- ✅ Connect with any PostgreSQL client (psql, pgAdmin, etc.)
- ✅ Execute SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- ✅ JOIN operations (Hash Join, Nested Loop)
- ✅ Aggregate functions with GROUP BY
- ✅ Transaction support with full MVCC
- ✅ Multiple concurrent connections

### What's Missing for Production
- ❌ Data persistence (memory-only currently)
- ❌ INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- ❌ Indexes for performance
- ❌ Authentication and security
- ❌ Distributed capabilities

## Progress Metrics
- **Core Components**: 9/9 completed (100%)
- **Test Coverage**: Average 75%+ across all packages
- **Code Quality**: 0 critical linting issues
- **Client Compatibility**: PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 ✅
- **Performance**: 886K+ TPS (in-memory)

## Current Sprint (Q1 2025)

### High Priority - Core Functionality

  - [ ] Implement UPDATE statement execution
  - [ ] Implement DELETE statement execution
  - [ ] Add constraint checking during DML

### Medium Priority - Production Features
- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization**
  - [ ] User management system
  - [ ] Password authentication
  - [ ] Role-based access control
  - [ ] Per-table permissions
- [ ] **Extended Query Protocol**
  - [ ] Parse/Bind/Execute message handling
  - [ ] Prepared statement caching
  - [ ] Parameter type inference
  - [ ] Portal management

### Low Priority - Nice to Have
- [ ] TLS/SSL support for connections
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Basic monitoring endpoints
- [ ] EXPLAIN query plans

## Future Sprints

### Distributed Systems (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Design cluster membership and discovery
- [ ] Implement consensus algorithm (Raft)
- [ ] Create data replication system
- [ ] Implement data partitioning/sharding
- [ ] Design failover and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement load balancing
- [ ] Create cluster monitoring and health checks

### Advanced SQL Features (Q2-Q3 2025)
- [ ] Subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated)
- [ ] Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- [ ] Window functions
- [ ] Full outer joins
- [ ] UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
- [ ] Stored procedures
- [ ] Triggers
- [ ] Views and materialized views

### Performance & Optimization (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Parallel query execution
- [ ] Adaptive query optimization
- [ ] Index-only scans
- [ ] Bitmap indexes
- [ ] Columnar storage option
- [ ] Compression

### Enterprise Features (Q4 2025)
- [ ] Backup and restore
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Encryption at rest
- [ ] Resource management
- [ ] Multi-tenancy
- [ ] Data masking

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/dshills/QuantaDB
cd QuantaDB
make build

# Start the server
./build/quantadb --port 5432

# Connect with psql (in another terminal)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U user -d database

# Try some queries
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY name;
SELECT u.name, p.name FROM users u JOIN products p ON u.id = p.id;
```

## Environment Setup
1. Install Go 1.24.4 or later
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/dshills/QuantaDB`
3. Install development dependencies: `make dev-deps`
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Build: `make build`

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage > 80% for new code
- Integration tests for all SQL features
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Test with real PostgreSQL clients

### Code Standards
- Follow Go best practices
- Use interfaces for extensibility
- Document all public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linter clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Benchmarks included (if applicable)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Security Considerations
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Authentication and authorization system
- TLS for client connections and inter-node communication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Encryption at rest (future)
