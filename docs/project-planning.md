# QuantaDB Project Planning

## Project Status Summary
**Current Version**: v0.1.0-alpha  
**Development Stage**: Pre-production (Storage integration in progress)  
**Key Achievement**: PostgreSQL-compatible SQL database with disk-based storage

### What Works Today
- ✅ Connect with PostgreSQL wire protocol
- ✅ Execute SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT
- ✅ JOIN operations (Hash Join, Nested Loop)
- ✅ Aggregate functions with GROUP BY
- ✅ Transaction support with full MVCC
- ✅ Multiple concurrent connections
- ✅ CREATE TABLE with persistent storage
- ✅ Basic INSERT operations to disk
- ✅ Page-based storage with buffer pool
- ✅ B+Tree index implementation (not integrated)

### What's In Progress
- 🔄 PostgreSQL client connection stability
- 🔄 UPDATE and DELETE operations
- 🔄 Storage-transaction integration

### What's Missing for Production
- ❌ Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- ❌ Index usage in query planning
- ❌ Authentication and security
- ❌ Distributed capabilities
- ❌ Backup and recovery

## Progress Metrics
- **Core Components**: 12/12 completed (100%)
- **Storage Integration**: 70% complete
- **Test Coverage**: Average 75%+ across all packages
- **Code Quality**: 0 critical linting issues
- **Client Compatibility**: PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 (SSL negotiation added)
- **Performance**: 886K+ TPS (in-memory), disk performance TBD

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/dshills/QuantaDB
cd QuantaDB
make build

# Start the server with persistent storage
./build/quantadb --data ./data --port 5432

# Connect with psql (in another terminal)
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U user -d database

# Create tables and insert data
CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER NOT NULL, name TEXT NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO users (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

# Query the data
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT name, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY name;
```

**Note**: PostgreSQL client connections are currently unstable. Use for development only.

## Environment Setup
1. Install Go 1.24.4 or later
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/dshills/QuantaDB`
3. Install development dependencies: `make dev-deps`
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Build: `make build`

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage > 80% for new code
- Integration tests for all SQL features
- Benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Test with real PostgreSQL clients

### Code Standards
- Follow Go best practices
- Use interfaces for extensibility
- Document all public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linter clean
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Benchmarks included (if applicable)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Security Considerations
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Authentication and authorization system
- TLS for client connections and inter-node communication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Encryption at rest (future)
