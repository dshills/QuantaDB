# Phase 5: Distributed Query Planning

**Status**: Planning
**Prerequisites**: Phase 4 Complete âœ…

## Overview

Phase 5 focuses on distributed query planning and execution capabilities to enable QuantaDB to scale horizontally across multiple nodes.

## Key Components

### 5.1 Distributed Query Planning
- Query fragment generation
- Data locality optimization
- Network cost modeling
- Distributed join strategies

### 5.2 Distributed Execution
- Remote operator execution
- Data shuffling and exchange
- Distributed transaction coordination
- Result aggregation

### 5.3 Testing & Validation
- TPC-H benchmark implementation
- Performance regression detection
- Distributed testing framework

## Next Steps

1. Complete TPC-H benchmarks for single-node performance baseline
2. Design distributed architecture components
3. Implement query fragmentation logic
4. Build distributed execution framework
