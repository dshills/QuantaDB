# Query Performance Optimization Plan for QuantaDB

## Executive Summary

QuantaDB has achieved 100% TPC-H query coverage with a solid foundation including:
- Cost-based optimizer with sophisticated selectivity estimation
- Three join algorithms (nested loop, hash, merge)
- Statistics collection with histograms
- Index selection and pushdown optimizations

However, performance optimization opportunities exist, particularly in parallel execution, monitoring, and adaptive query processing. This plan outlines a phased approach to dramatically improve query performance.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Multiple Join Algorithms**: Hash join, merge join, and nested loop join implementations
2. **Cost-Based Optimizer**: Sophisticated cost model with statistics-based selectivity estimation
3. **Statistics Infrastructure**: ANALYZE command with histogram support
4. **Optimization Rules**: Predicate pushdown, projection pushdown, constant folding, subquery decorrelation

### Gaps
1. **No Parallel Execution**: All operations are single-threaded
2. **Limited Monitoring**: No EXPLAIN ANALYZE or detailed execution metrics
3. **No Plan Caching**: Every query is re-planned from scratch
4. **No Adaptive Execution**: Plans don't adjust based on runtime feedback
5. **Memory Management**: No work memory limits or spill-to-disk for large operations

## Phase 1: Performance Monitoring & Profiling (2-3 weeks)

### Goal
Establish baseline performance metrics and provide visibility into query execution.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Implement EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Add timing instrumentation to all operators
- Track actual vs estimated rows
- Measure buffer I/O statistics
- Record memory usage per operator

```go
type RuntimeStats struct {
    StartupTimeMs   float64
    TotalTimeMs     float64
    ActualRows      int64
    ActualLoops     int64
    BuffersHit      int64
    BuffersRead     int64
    MemoryUsedBytes int64
}
```

#### 1.2 Create Performance Schema
- Query execution history table
- Plan cache metadata
- Statistics history
- Slow query log

#### 1.3 Add Profiling Framework
- CPU profiling integration
- Memory profiling hooks
- I/O wait time tracking
- Lock contention monitoring

### Deliverables
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE command working
- Performance dashboard showing top slow queries
- Baseline benchmarks for all TPC-H queries

## Phase 2: Query Plan Caching (1-2 weeks)

### Goal
Eliminate planning overhead for repeated queries.

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Implement Plan Cache
- LRU cache for prepared statements
- Parameterized plan storage
- Cache invalidation on schema/stats changes

```go
type PlanCache struct {
    cache     map[string]*CachedPlan
    lru       *list.List
    maxSize   int
    mu        sync.RWMutex
}

type CachedPlan struct {
    Plan           PhysicalPlan
    Parameters     []types.DataType
    LastUsed       time.Time
    ExecutionCount int64
    AvgExecutionMs float64
}
```

#### 2.2 Generic Plan Generation
- Create plans that work for different parameter values
- Identify when to use custom vs generic plans
- Track plan performance over time

### Deliverables
- 50%+ reduction in planning time for repeated queries
- Cache hit rate >80% for OLTP workloads

## Phase 3: Parallel Query Execution (4-6 weeks)

### Goal
Utilize multiple CPU cores for query execution.

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Parallel Execution Framework
```go
type ParallelContext struct {
    WorkerPool     *WorkerPool
    MaxParallelism int
    WorkMem        int64
    Coordinator    *Coordinator
}

type WorkerPool struct {
    workers    []*Worker
    taskQueue  chan Task
    resultChan chan Result
}
```

#### 3.2 Parallel Operators

### Deliverables
- 3-4x speedup on TPC-H queries with 4 cores
- Near-linear scaling up to 8 cores
- Configurable parallelism degree

## Phase 4: Adaptive Query Execution (3-4 weeks)

### Goal
Dynamically adjust query plans based on runtime statistics.

    chosenMethod  JoinMethod // Hash, Merge, or NestedLoop
    switchPoint   int64      // Row count to trigger switch
}
```

## Conclusion

This plan provides a systematic approach to dramatically improve QuantaDB's query performance. The phased approach ensures each step provides value while building toward a state-of-the-art query execution engine. The focus on monitoring and profiling in Phase 1 ensures we can measure and validate improvements throughout the implementation.

Total estimated time: 12-16 weeks for full implementation, with significant improvements visible after just 2-3 weeks.
