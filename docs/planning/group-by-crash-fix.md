# GROUP BY Crash Fix Implementation

## Problem Analysis

The GROUP BY crash occurs because:
1. The AggregateOperator's `processInput()` is called during `Open()`
2. If `processInput()` returns an error, the operator is left in an invalid state
3. When `Next()` is called, it finds `groupIter` is nil and returns an error
4. The error handling in the network layer might not properly handle this case

## Key Issues Found

1. **Error State Management**: If `processInput()` fails, the operator state is incomplete
2. **Nil Checks**: While there are nil checks, the error might not propagate correctly
3. **Network Layer**: The crash happens in lib/pq at QueryContext, suggesting improper error handling

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Defensive State Management
- Ensure AggregateOperator is in a valid state even if Open() fails
- Initialize groupIter to empty slice instead of nil
- Add a flag to track if operator was successfully opened

### 2. Improve Error Propagation
- Ensure errors from Open() are properly propagated
- Add context to errors for better debugging
- Log errors at appropriate levels

### 3. Fix Next() Method
- Check if operator was properly initialized before processing
- Return proper EOF instead of error for uninitialized state
- Add better error messages

## Code Changes

### aggregate.go modifications:
1. Add `initialized` flag to track Open() success
2. Initialize `groupIter` to empty slice in constructor
3. Check initialization state in Next()
4. Improve error messages with context

### executor.go modifications:
1. Ensure Open() errors are properly propagated
2. Add logging for debugging

### connection.go modifications:
1. Handle executor errors more gracefully
2. Ensure proper error responses are sent to client
