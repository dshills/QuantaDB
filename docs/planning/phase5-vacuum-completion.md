# Phase 5: Vacuum Process Implementation - Completion Report

## Summary
Successfully implemented the VACUUM process for cleaning up old MVCC versions, completing Phase 5 of the transaction-storage integration.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Horizon Tracking (`internal/txn/horizon.go`)
- Created `HorizonTracker` to track oldest active transaction snapshots
- Integrated with transaction manager lifecycle
- Added safety configuration for conservative vacuum operations
- Provides `GetSafeHorizon()` method with configurable safety margins

### 2. Vacuum Scanner (`internal/sql/executor/vacuum_scanner.go`)
- Scans tables to identify dead versions eligible for removal
- Respects transaction horizon for safety
- Supports both table-wide and chain-specific scanning
- Provides detailed statistics on dead version discovery

### 3. Vacuum Executor (`internal/sql/executor/vacuum_executor.go`)
- Executes the actual removal of dead versions
- Implements version chain relinking to maintain consistency
- Processes dead versions in configurable batches
- **Key Fix**: Handles standalone dead versions (no predecessors)
- Collects comprehensive statistics including space reclaimed

### 4. SQL Integration
- Added VACUUM token to parser (`internal/sql/parser/token.go`)
- Implemented VACUUM statement AST node (`internal/sql/parser/ast.go`)
- Added parseVacuum method to parser (`internal/sql/parser/parser.go`)
- Created LogicalVacuum plan node (`internal/sql/planner/ddl_plans.go`)
- Integrated with query executor (`internal/sql/executor/executor.go`)

### 5. Test Coverage
- `vacuum_simple_test.go`: Basic vacuum functionality with manually marked deletions
- `vacuum_chain_test.go`: Version chain management and relinking
- Parser integration tests for VACUUM syntax

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. In-Place Updates with Version Backup
The update strategy creates a backup of the old version on first update, then performs subsequent updates in-place. This minimizes version chain length while maintaining MVCC semantics.

### 2. Conservative Vacuum Safety
Default configuration includes:
- 5-minute minimum age before vacuum eligibility
- 100 timestamp unit safety margin
- Respects all active transaction snapshots

### 3. Batch Processing
Vacuum processes dead versions in batches to:
- Limit memory usage
- Allow throttling for production systems
- Provide progress visibility

## Test Results

### Basic Vacuum Test
```
Found 1 dead versions
Vacuum stats: Tables=1, Scanned=1, Removed=1, Space=63, ChainRelinks=0
After vacuum, row 2 cannot be read: row has been deleted (expected if vacuum worked)
```

### Version Chain Test
```
Version chain has 2 versions
Found 1 dead versions in chain
Vacuum stats: Tables=1, Scanned=1, Removed=1, Space=63, ChainRelinks=1
Old version correctly removed
```

## Outstanding Issues

1. **Transaction Test API Mismatches**: Several test files need updating due to BeginTransaction signature changes
2. **Page Compaction**: Optional optimization not yet implemented
3. **Performance**: Predecessor finding could benefit from reverse indexing

## Next Steps

Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing and Validation
- Fix transaction test API mismatches
- Add stress tests for vacuum under load
- Implement automated vacuum scheduling
- Add vacuum progress monitoring

## Conclusion

Phase 5 is complete with all core vacuum functionality working correctly. The system can now:
- Identify dead versions based on transaction horizons
- Safely remove old versions while maintaining consistency
- Relink version chains to skip removed versions
- Execute VACUUM commands through SQL interface

The implementation provides a solid foundation for space reclamation in the MVCC system.
