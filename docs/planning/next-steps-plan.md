- Multi-column indexes: 5-10x improvement for covered queries
- Index-only scans: 50-80% I/O reduction
- TPC-H queries: < 2x PostgreSQL execution time

### Quality Targets
- Test coverage: > 80% for new code
- Zero data corruption bugs
- All SQL-92 core features supported
- Memory usage: < 2x data size for queries

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Sort-merge complexity**: Start with simple cases, add features incrementally
2. **Index format changes**: Version index format, support migration
3. **Performance regressions**: Continuous benchmarking, feature flags
4. **Memory usage**: Implement spilling early, monitor in tests

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope creep**: Stick to planned features, defer nice-to-haves
2. **Complex bugs**: Time-box debugging, ask for help early
3. **Integration issues**: Test continuously, small increments
