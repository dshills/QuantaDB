# Query Planner Integration Architecture

## Overview

The Query Planner Integration enhances QuantaDB with adaptive query execution capabilities, allowing the database to dynamically optimize execution strategies based on runtime conditions.

## Key Components

### 1. Adaptive Physical Planner (`adaptive_physical_planner.go`)

The core component that extends the standard physical planner with runtime adaptability:

- **MemoryPressureMonitor**: Tracks system memory usage and prevents memory exhaustion
- **OperatorHistoryTracker**: Records historical performance data for operators
- **AdaptiveVectorizationDecider**: Makes intelligent decisions about when to use vectorized execution
- **RuntimeFeedbackCollector**: Gathers execution statistics for continuous optimization

### 2. Enhanced Vectorized Cost Model (`enhanced_vectorized_cost_model.go`)

Provides per-operator cost estimation for better planning decisions:

- Operator-specific cost functions (scan, filter, join, aggregate, sort)
- Expression complexity analysis
- Memory requirements estimation
- Confidence scoring for cost predictions

### 3. Runtime Feedback System (`runtime_feedback_collector.go`)

Enables the planner to learn from execution history:

- Collects actual vs predicted performance metrics
- Updates cost models based on real execution data
- Tracks query patterns and operator performance
- Provides calibration for future planning

### 4. Cache-Integrated Planning (`cache_integrated_planner.go`)

Integrates result caching decisions into query planning:

- Cost-benefit analysis for caching
- Cache invalidation tracking
- Memory-aware caching decisions
- Cache hit rate monitoring

### 5. Adaptive Executor (`adaptive_executor.go`)

The executor that leverages adaptive planning:

- Integrates with AdaptivePhysicalPlanner
- Monitors execution progress
- Supports runtime plan adaptation
- Collects and reports execution metrics

### 6. Adaptive Operators (`adaptive_operators.go`)

Operators that can switch execution modes at runtime:

- Wrap both scalar and vectorized implementations
- Monitor performance and detect issues
- Switch modes based on runtime conditions
- Track execution metrics

## Execution Flow

1. **Query Planning Phase**:
   - Logical plan is converted to physical plan
   - Cost models evaluate different execution strategies
   - Adaptive decisions consider memory pressure and historical data
   - Initial execution mode is selected

2. **Runtime Adaptation**:
   - Operators monitor their performance
   - Memory pressure is continuously tracked
   - Execution modes can be switched if beneficial
   - Feedback is collected for future queries

3. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Actual execution metrics are recorded
   - Cost models are calibrated
   - Operator history is updated
   - Future planning decisions improve

## Configuration

The system is highly configurable through:

```go
type AdaptiveExecutorConfig struct {
    EnableAdaptiveExecution  bool    // Enable/disable adaptive features
    ReplanThreshold         float64  // When to trigger re-planning
    MaxReplanAttempts       int      // Limit re-planning attempts
    EnableOperatorAdaptation bool    // Allow operators to switch modes
    AdaptiveBatchSize       int      // Batch size for vectorized ops
    MemoryPressureThreshold float64  // Memory pressure trigger
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance Optimization**: Automatically chooses the best execution strategy
2. **Memory Safety**: Prevents out-of-memory conditions by adapting to memory pressure
3. **Learning System**: Improves over time based on execution history
4. **Flexibility**: Can switch between execution modes at runtime
5. **Cost Accuracy**: Continuously calibrates cost models for better predictions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models for cost prediction
2. **Distributed Execution**: Extend adaptive planning to distributed queries
3. **Advanced Statistics**: Incorporate more sophisticated statistics collection
4. **Query Compilation**: Add JIT compilation for hot code paths
5. **Hardware Acceleration**: Support GPU/SIMD acceleration where beneficial
