# QuantaDB Roadmap

**Last Updated**: December 24, 2024

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestone Achieved

**QuantaDB has achieved 100% TPC-H benchmark coverage!** All 22 complex analytical queries are now working, demonstrating enterprise-grade SQL capabilities including correlated subqueries, complex joins, and advanced aggregations.
