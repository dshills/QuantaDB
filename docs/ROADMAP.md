# QuantaDB Roadmap

**Last Updated**: December 18, 2024

## Project Status

QuantaDB has achieved its initial goal of becoming a functional PostgreSQL-compatible database with persistent storage and crash recovery. All critical foundational features are now complete.

### âœ… Completed Milestones

1. **Core SQL Engine**
   - Full SQL parser with lexer and AST
   - Query planner with optimization
   - Physical operators (scan, filter, join, aggregate, sort)

2. **Storage Layer**
   - Page-based disk storage with buffer pool
   - Slotted page format for variable-length records
   - CREATE TABLE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

3. **Transaction Support**
   - MVCC implementation with multiple isolation levels
   - Timestamp-based versioning
   - Transaction state management

4. **Durability**
   - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) with CRC32 checksums
   - Three-phase crash recovery
   - Checkpoint mechanism

5. **Network Protocol**
   - PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 compatibility
   - SSL negotiation support
   - Stable client connections
