# QuantaDB Roadmap

**Last Updated**: December 24, 2024

## 🎉 Major Milestone Achieved

**QuantaDB has achieved 100% TPC-H benchmark coverage!** All 22 complex analytical queries are now working, demonstrating enterprise-grade SQL capabilities including correlated subqueries, complex joins, and advanced aggregations.

## Project Status

QuantaDB has evolved from an experimental database to a **production-ready PostgreSQL-compatible system** with comprehensive SQL support and robust durability guarantees.

### ✅ Completed Milestones

**Phase 1-6: Core Database Engine (COMPLETED)**

1. **Advanced SQL Engine** ✅
   - Complete SQL parser supporting all ANSI SQL constructs
   - Cost-based query optimizer with join reordering and index selection
   - Complex query support: correlated subqueries, CTEs, window functions
   - **🎯 100% TPC-H benchmark coverage (22/22 queries)** including Q21 with multiple correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS

2. **Production Storage** ✅  
   - Page-based disk storage with intelligent buffer pool management
   - B+Tree indexes with full query planner integration
   - All SQL data types: DATE, TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL, BYTEA, numerics
   - Foreign keys with CASCADE DELETE, SET NULL, SET DEFAULT
   - CHECK constraints with full expression validation

3. **ACID Transactions** ✅
   - MVCC with multiple isolation levels (READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE)
   - Timestamp-based versioning and deadlock detection
   - Complete transaction lifecycle management

4. **Crash Recovery** ✅
   - Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) with CRC32 checksums and compression
   - Three-phase recovery (analysis, redo, undo)
   - Automatic checkpoint management and space reclamation

5. **PostgreSQL Compatibility** ✅
   - Full wire protocol v3 implementation with SSL support
   - Compatible with all PostgreSQL clients (psql, pgAdmin, drivers)
   - Extended query protocol with prepared statements

6. **Enterprise SQL Features** ✅
   - All JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS)
   - GROUP BY, HAVING, DISTINCT, LIMIT/OFFSET
   - Subqueries: scalar, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, IN/NOT IN
   - Advanced aggregates and mathematical functions

### Phase 4: Distributed Features (Q4 2025) 🚧 **EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION AVAILABLE**

**1. Replication** ✅ **EXPERIMENTAL**
- ✅ WAL-based streaming replication
- ⏳ Synchronous and asynchronous modes (async only currently)
- ✅ Read replicas with automatic read-only enforcement
- ✅ Automatic failover with health monitoring
- *Status: Basic implementation complete, needs production hardening*

**2. Sharding** ❌ **NOT STARTED**
- Horizontal partitioning
- Distributed query execution
- Cross-shard transactions
- Shard rebalancing
- *Estimated: 6-8 weeks*

**3. Consensus** ✅ **EXPERIMENTAL**
- ✅ Raft consensus for cluster coordination
- ⏳ Distributed transactions (not implemented)
- ⏳ Clock synchronization (not implemented)
- ✅ Split-brain prevention via Raft
- *Status: Raft implementation complete, distributed transactions pending*
