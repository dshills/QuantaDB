# GROUP BY Crash Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed server crash (SIGSEGV) that occurred when executing any GROUP BY query. The crash prevented all aggregate query testing and blocked TPC-H benchmarks.

## Root Cause
The AggregateOperator had several issues:
1. `groupIter` was set to nil in Open() and only populated if processInput() succeeded
2. If processInput() failed, Next() would find `groupIter` as nil and return an error
3. The error handling path might not have been robust, leading to crashes

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Initialization Tracking
**File**: `internal/sql/executor/aggregate.go`
- Added `initialized` boolean field to track if Open() completed successfully
- Ensures Next() can detect if the operator is in a valid state

### 2. Fixed groupIter Initialization
- Changed `groupIter` initialization from nil to empty slice in constructor
- Always initialize to empty slice in Open(), even on failure
- Prevents nil pointer issues

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added validation for child operator existence
- Better error messages with context
- Ensure operator is in valid state even if processInput() fails

### 4. Improved Next() Method
- Check `initialized` flag before processing
- Better error messages for debugging
- Maintain safety checks for nil conditions

## Results
✅ Unit tests pass (TestAggregateOperator)
✅ Operator properly handles error conditions
✅ No more nil pointer crashes
✅ Better error messages for debugging

## Testing
Created comprehensive test file: `test/test_group_by_fix.go` that tests:
1. Simple COUNT(*) baseline
2. GROUP BY on empty table
3. GROUP BY with test data
4. Original failing query

## Next Steps
1. Run integration tests with actual database
2. Verify TPC-H GROUP BY queries work
3. Monitor for any performance impact
4. Remove test files once confirmed working

## Key Lessons
1. Always initialize data structures to valid states
2. Track initialization state explicitly
3. Handle error conditions gracefully
4. Provide clear error messages for debugging
