## Current Sprint (Q1 2025)

### High Priority - Core Functionality
1. **Persistent Storage Engine**
   - Page-based storage format (8KB pages)
   - Buffer pool manager with LRU eviction
   - Write-ahead logging (WAL)
   - Checkpoint mechanism
   - Crash recovery

2. **DML Operations**
   - INSERT statement execution
   - UPDATE with WHERE clause
   - DELETE with WHERE clause
   - Constraint checking during DML

3. **Extended Query Protocol**
   - Parse/Bind/Execute message flow
   - Prepared statement caching
   - Parameter type inference
   - Portal management

### Medium Priority - Production Features
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - User management system
   - Password authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Per-table permissions

2. **Query Enhancements**
   - Subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated)
   - Common Table Expressions (WITH)
   - UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT
   - More built-in functions

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Query result caching
   - Connection pooling
   - Statistics auto-update
   - Parallel query execution

## Future Roadmap

### Q2 2025: Distributed Foundation
- **Cluster Management**
  - Node discovery and membership
  - Health monitoring
  - Configuration management
  
- **Consensus Layer**
  - Raft implementation
  - Leader election
  - Log replication
  
- **Data Distribution**
  - Range-based sharding
  - Partition management
  - Rebalancing

### Q3 2025: Advanced SQL
- **Advanced Features**
  - Window functions
  - Recursive queries
  - Full outer joins
  - Stored procedures
  - Triggers
  
- **Performance Features**
  - Materialized views
  - Bitmap indexes
  - Index-only scans
  - Query plan hints
  
### Q4 2025: Enterprise Features
- **Operations**
  - Online backup/restore
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Performance monitoring
  - Audit logging
  
- **Security**
  - TLS/SSL support
  - Encryption at rest
  - Row-level security
  - Data masking

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
Built the core SQL engine with in-memory storage, establishing patterns and interfaces that will scale to distributed operation.

### Phase 2: Persistence (Current)
Adding durability through disk-based storage, WAL, and crash recovery. This phase makes QuantaDB suitable for single-node production use.

### Phase 3: Distribution (Future)
Implementing consensus, sharding, and replication to create a truly distributed database.

### Phase 4: Enterprise (Future)
Adding advanced features needed for enterprise deployments: security, monitoring, and operational tools.

## Design Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive tests before implementation
3. **Production-Ready**: Each phase produces usable software
4. **Standards Compliance**: Follow SQL standards where possible
5. **Performance Focus**: Measure and optimize at each step

## Success Metrics

### Current Achievements
- ✅ PostgreSQL client compatibility
- ✅ 886K+ TPS for in-memory operations
- ✅ Full SQL query support (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)
- ✅ ACID transactions with MVCC
- ✅ B+Tree indexing with query optimization

### Next Milestones
- [ ] Persistent storage with crash recovery
- [ ] 100K+ TPS for disk-based operations
- [ ] Full DML support (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Prepared statement support
- [ ] Basic authentication
