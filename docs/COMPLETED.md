  - Created statistics collection executor
  - Collect table/column statistics (row count, distinct values, histograms)
  - Store statistics in catalog with StatsWriter interface
  - Update planner to use fresh statistics
  - **Location**: `internal/sql/executor/analyze.go` and `internal/catalog/stats.go`
  - **Impact**: Accurate query cost estimation using real table data

## Storage & Durability

  - Unit tests for parameter substitution
  - **Location**: `internal/network/` and `internal/sql/`
  - **Impact**: Prepared statements now work - all PostgreSQL drivers can connect!

### Network and Connection Management
- ✅ **Network connection management** - Robust connection handling
- ✅ **Fixed PostgreSQL client connection timeout issue** (December 19, 2024)
  - Replaced blocking `bufio.Reader.Peek(8)` with proper message reading
  - Now reads startup message length first, then the rest of the message
  - Handles SSL negotiation correctly without blocking
  - Added better error logging and debugging information
  - PostgreSQL drivers (pq, pgx) can now connect successfully

### Error Handling
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Error Code Mapping** (December 19, 2024)
  - Created comprehensive error code mapping system
  - Mapped all errors to PostgreSQL SQLSTATE codes (300+ codes)
  - Updated network layer to send proper error responses
  - Created category-specific error constructors
  - Added error details (table, column, constraint, etc.)
  - Documented error codes in `docs/error-mapping.md`
  - Added comprehensive tests
  - **Location**: `internal/errors/` package
  - **Impact**: Full PostgreSQL client compatibility with proper error handling

## Security & Stability

### Security Improvements
- ✅ **Fixed BackendKeyData generation (crypto/rand)** - Secure random number generation
- ✅ **Applied write timeouts in connection handler** - Prevent hanging connections
- ✅ **Resolved SSL negotiation issues** - Proper SSL support

### Transaction Support
- ✅ **MVCC transaction support** - Multi-version concurrency control implementation
- ✅ **Prepared statements (Parse/Bind/Execute/Describe/Close)** - Full prepared statement support

## Testing & Quality

### Driver Compatibility
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Driver Compatibility Testing** (December 19, 2024)
  - Test Go pq driver with prepared statements
  - Test Go pgx driver with batch operations
  - Test JDBC driver (PreparedStatement)
  - Test Python psycopg2 with server-side cursors
  - Test Node.js pg driver
  - Document compatibility in `docs/driver-compatibility-report.md`
  - Created extensive test suite in `test/driver-tests/`
  - **Impact**: All major PostgreSQL drivers now work with QuantaDB!

### Code Quality Improvements
