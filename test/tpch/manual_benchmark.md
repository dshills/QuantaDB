# Manual TPC-H Benchmark Results

## Test Environment
- QuantaDB Version: c5c81a1
- Date: December 21, 2024
- Scale Factor: 0.01 (test data)

## Connection Issues

Currently experiencing PostgreSQL wire protocol compatibility issues:
- Server starts successfully on port 5432
- TCP connections are accepted
- PostgreSQL clients (lib/pq) fail during startup phase
- Error: "failed to read startup message length: EOF"

## Root Cause

The issue appears to be in the PostgreSQL protocol implementation:
1. Client connects and sends startup message
2. Server expects specific PostgreSQL protocol format
3. Connection is immediately closed after startup phase

## Next Steps

To properly benchmark QuantaDB, we need to:

1. **Fix PostgreSQL Protocol Compatibility**
   - The startup message handling needs debugging
   - SSL negotiation might be causing issues
   - Authentication flow needs verification

2. **Alternative Approach**
   - Build a custom client that speaks QuantaDB's protocol
   - Use the internal test framework
   - Create integration tests that bypass the network layer

3. **Direct Testing**
   - Test the query executor directly without network layer
   - Measure optimizer performance in unit tests
   - Use the planner benchmarks already in the codebase

## Current Status

The TPC-H benchmark framework is complete and ready to use:
- ✅ Schema defined
- ✅ Data generator implemented  
- ✅ Queries implemented
- ✅ Benchmark runner created
- ❌ Cannot execute due to protocol issues

## Recommendations

1. Fix the PostgreSQL protocol compatibility issue first
2. Consider implementing a simple text-based protocol for testing
3. Add integration tests that test the executor directly
4. Use existing benchmark tests in the planner package
