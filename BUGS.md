# Bug and Architecture Issues

## Unused or Stub Packages
- `internal/cluster` and `internal/config` are empty directories; remove or implement these packages.
- `pkg/client` and `pkg/protocol` are empty; client and protocol libraries are unimplemented.
- `cmd/quantactl` and `cmd/test-client` contain placeholder code; CLI commands and test client lack functionality.

## Configuration Management
- The `--config` flag in `cmd/quantadb/main.go` is parsed but never applied; no configuration file is loaded.
- Default values (host, port, data directory) are hard-coded in flags; lacks centralized config validation or schema.

## Documentation
- Extensive outdated planning and archive documents under `docs/archive`, `docs/planning`, and `docs/implementation` cause duplication and confusion.
- No single, up-to-date architectural overview; documentation is fragmented across multiple folders.

## Code Duplication and Architecture Smells
- The `Connection` struct in `internal/network` exceeds 900 lines, mixing concerns: protocol parsing, planning, execution, and response formatting.
- Tight coupling between network, SQL parser, planner, executor, catalog, engine, storage, and transactions; modules are not well encapsulated.
- Mixing of the in-memory engine (`internal/engine`) and MVCC storage backend (`executor.NewMVCCStorageBackend`) creates parallel abstractions.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Error type inference relies on fragile string matching (`strings.Contains`, `strings.Split`) on error messages.
- Contexts are often ignored or replaced with `context.Background()`, bypassing cancellation and deadlines.
- `memoryEngine.Close()` sets its internal map to `nil`, leading to potential nil-pointer dereferences on subsequent operations.

## Security
- SSL/TLS is not supported; SSL request is responded with `'N'` and connections remain unencrypted.
- Authentication in `Connection.handleAuthentication` unconditionally accepts all clients; no credential checks or access control.

## Data Persistence and Durability
- The example database file `data/quantadb.db` is committed to source control; should be ignored or relocated.
- WAL manager is optional and emits only a warning if initialization fails, potentially risking data loss without clear guidance.

## Testing
- No integration tests for disk-backed storage; most tests use in-memory components.
- Extended query protocol and error scenarios lack comprehensive tests (e.g., timeout, SSL, protocol errors).

## Performance and Concurrency
- The in-memory engine uses a single `sync.RWMutex` for all operations; may become a scalability bottleneck.
- Fixed-size buffer pool without eviction policy details; potential memory pressure under load.
- Connection handling spawns one goroutine per client with no backpressure or queuing mechanism beyond `MaxConnections`.
